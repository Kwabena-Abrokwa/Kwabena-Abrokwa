### Hi there, I am Frank Kwabena Abrokwa ðŸ‘‹

##For the past three years, I've mostly programming with Javascript and PHP. With Node Js and Laravel, I constructed a number of fascinating React applications (Progressive Web Applications) and REST-ful APIs using Javascript and PHP. I also use React Native to create mobile apps. I'm currently studying Django in order to create RESTful APIs.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Algorithms with JavaScript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with remote job
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any Tech related
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do everything JavaScript (React, Node Js, React Native, Vue), Laravel (PHP) and Django (Python)
